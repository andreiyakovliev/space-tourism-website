# Space tourism multi-page website

My challenge is to build out this multi-page space tourism website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

This project is a collaboration between Frontend Mentor, Scrimba, and Kevin Powell.

The users should be able to:

- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information
- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Technologies:

HTML, CSS (SCSS), JavaScript, GULP.

Responsive design
